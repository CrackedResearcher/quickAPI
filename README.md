A *blazing-fast* API mock tool for frontend devs—build prototypes without waiting for the backend!    


---
 
### **Why You Need It (I built it -soo)**  
- **No more backend delays** – Start building immediately, even if the backend isn’t done.  
- **Seamless testing** – Simulate real-world API responses, errors, and delays.  
- **Work independently** – Frontend and backend teams can develop in parallel.  

---

## 🔧 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Upload Your Spec** – Use a simple JSON file to define your API structure (endpoints, methods, and responses).  
2️⃣ **Generate Mock APIs** – QuickAPI instantly spins up mock endpoints for testing.  
3️⃣ **Start Using It** – Get a base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) and integrate it into your app.  
4️⃣ **Test & Iterate** – Play around with the mock API using a browser, Postman, or Swagger UI.  

> **Example Spec:** Define an endpoint like `GET /products` to return fake product data or `POST /orders` for order confirmation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

### **Backend: FastAPI**  
- **Why?** Fast, async, and auto-generates OpenAPI docs.  
- **Role:** Parses the spec, generates endpoints, and serves them dynamically.  

### **Frontend: Next.js**  
- **Why?** Clean UI for uploading specs and managing mock APIs.  
- **Role:** Provides a simple web dashboard to interact with the tool.  

### **Other Supporting Tech**  
- **Python & FastAPI** – Handles API logic and mock generation.  
- **Node.js & Next.js** – Runs the frontend interface.  
- **JSON** – Defines API structures for easy sharing.
